# About Inkberry

Inkberry is a free and open-source tool. Its aim is to make the creation of web games with InkleStudio’s Ink/Inky a bit easier.

While Inky is a great tool for game creation, it lacks a live browser preview. That’s where inkberry comes in! Inkberry automatically recompiles your story when it changes and displays the result in a window that is pretty much like a browser. This allows you to quickly test how your game behaves.

Inkberry is not a replacement for Inky, but rather a companion to it. In fact, you are supposed to use both in tandem. :)
